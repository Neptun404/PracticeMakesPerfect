// 1. To import functions from part_1.ts or part_2.ts, you can do so by following these steps:
// 2. Import the specific functions you want to use from the file. To do this, use the following syntax:
//    import { functionName } from './relativePathToFile';
//    For example, to import the sum function from part_1.ts, you would use:
//    import { sum } from './src/part_1';
// 3. Once you've imported the function, you can use it in your code. 
//    For example, you could run the sum function by calling it like this: sum(1, 2);
// 4. To test your functions.
//    To run every test, you can use the following command: npm run test 
//    To run only tests for part_1, you can use the following command: npm run test part_1
//    To run only tests for part_2, you can use the following command: npm run test part_2
